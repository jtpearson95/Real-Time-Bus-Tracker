This project pulls live data from a public API to track the locations of MBTA busses in the Cambridge area. The busses are represented by markers pinpointing the coordinates provided; as structured, the map updates every 10 seconds. In order to run, you need all the files provided, and you need to use a local server. You will also need to have your own API key for google maps.
